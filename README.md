# Student-Information
My Student Information Project for Computer Programming 2 class.
It is a Windows Form Application that stores student information, such as student ID, name, and major.  Also allows you to activate and deactivate a student if they are not actively attending a semester.
The code behind the form is located in the Form1.cs folder.
